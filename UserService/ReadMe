Monolithic Architecture  :

 Designing an application on a single port no where all services are running on that port no. which you have defined
 
 
 Pizza Hut:  8080
 
 Menu 
 Order 
 Payment  -- Payment get failed due to any xyz reason)
 Notification ( Alert , Mail etc..) --- Order is getting processed 
 Menu 
 
 
 Enterprise large level of application : Amazon
 
 Microservice architecture : ( Costly)
 
 here we create multiple services on multiple port no's 
 
 Order Microservice -- 8081  -- eureka client
 User Microservice  -- 8082 -- eureka client
 Payment Microservice -- 8083  -- fall back method -- eureka client
 Notification Microservice -- 8084 -- eureka client
 Cloud Configuration Microservice -- 8085 -- eureka client
 
 Common gateway --- 9000 //
 
 Eureka Server  --- 8761   ---
 a) Spring web
 b) Eureka Server
 c) Actuator -- Health of your server ( Metric report)
 
 2 step :
 Add an annotation in main file as @EnableEurekaServer
 
 
 we have created two microservices 
 UserMicroservice : user1,user2,user3
 ContactMicroservice : 3 contacts are saved for a user1 , 2 contacts are saved for a user 2
 
 I want to fetch the contacts details from user microservice only so usermicroservice will internally call 
 contact microservice
 
 To communicate between user nd contact microservice we need either resttemplate or feignclient
